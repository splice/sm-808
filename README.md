# SM-808 Practice exercise

The goal of this exercise is to practice designing models and
interfaces.

There aren't good or bad solutions, there are solutions that
match the requirements and some that don't. There are solutions that
might be considered elegant by some and solutions that would be
considered clever.

## Building a Drum Machine

This exercise assumes you are somewhat familiar with drum machines.
If you aren't
please read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine

Your challenge is to code the sequencer part of our Drum Machine which
we called SM-808. More precisely you will need to sequence and "play"
your own version of the famous [four-on-the-floor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_on_the_floor_(music)) rhythm pattern.

Note that instead of hearing an actual sound, you are expected to
generate a real time visual representation of the sequence being played.
